Another Attempt at a Undertale Engine made on GameMaker 8.2. This isn't fully finished yet and things may change.

# How do you open the project?
You need gamemaker 8.2, You can get it from https://gm82.cherry-treehouse.com/ (I do not own GM82)

# It says it's missing fonts!
That's because you didn't install the fonts. Right Click the fonts then install them.
